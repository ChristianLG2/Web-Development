<p>Hello, I'm Christian Lira Gonz√°lez. I'm a Business Intelligence Engineer and Data Science Consultant with a strong passion for turning data into actionable insights.

 
With a focus on Business Analytics and minors in Data Analytics and Political Science, I've honed my skills in statistical analysis, machine learning, and database management. I'm proficient in tools like RStudio and Python, and I have hands-on experience with SQL for database design and querying.
            
What sets me apart is my ability to bridge the gap between technical data analysis and effective communication. I excel at transforming complex data into clear, compelling reports and presentations, empowering organizations to make data-driven decisions.
            
My background includes leading teams, both in the field of data analysis and during my service as an Ecclesiastical Service Missionary. I'm fluent in English, Spanish, and Chinese, and I'm continuously seeking opportunities to apply my expertise and contribute to meaningful projects...</p>
